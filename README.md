The entire starter kit should run offline.
All you need is a local server. MAMP has been tested.

The package.json file gives an overview of the starter and a couple of commands:
```
npm run babel-jsx-watch
npm run gulp-reload
```
To get up and running clone the starter from this repo. You will need to then run
```
npm install
```
